# Contributing to Transcriptase
I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## I Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## I Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/luke-buttifant/2Miners-Browser-Extension/issues)
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/luke-buttifant/2Miners-Browser-Extension/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!
